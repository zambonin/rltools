Practice I - Algorithms for Manipulation of Regular Languages

The language chosen to code these algorithms was Python, for it is easier to
manipulate object types dynamically. Almost all the information related to the
program's workings may be found through its manpage, with the command

    man ./rltools

where it is located (inside this folder). Invalid arguments will be rejected by
the program when possible.

A semi-automated test file was placed on the associated folder for these
operations, making it easier to claim the consistency of the I/O operations.
Powered by Bash scripting, it executes determinizations and conversions from and
to finite automata, regular grammars and regular expressions consecutively using
the same outputs it created earlier in a cyclic manner, asserting the files'
contents regularity.

    sh autotester.sh <non-deterministic finite automaton input file>

Finally, some design rules for an input automaton file are described below.
Grammar and expression files' structure is alike. Examples for those can be
generated using the above script.

* epsilon-moves must be added only to the required states;
* a state must consist of all the transitions through letters of the alphabet,
even if those are empty.

The regular expression parser accepts only unary letters alphabets. Hence, an
expression of the form "(q0|q1*)" will be parsed with the set {'q', '0', '1'}
as its symbols, and won't match a possible desired {'q0', 'q1'} set. Parenthesis
should be used whenever possible when describing regular expressions. The code
itself should be executed using Python 3.x.

Practice II - Lexical Analysis

The lexical structure [1], specifically built for this assignment, is presented
below, with some remarks about its inner workings. It can be used as a guide to
write possible "programs" with this proto-language, albeit syntactically and
semantically incorrect. Remember that the input file must end with a new line.

    keyword      ::= 'else' | 'if' | 'while' | 'read' | 'write' | 'list' |
                     'bool' | 'str' | 'int' | boolean
    boolean      ::= 'False' | 'True'
    identifier   ::= letter (letter | digit | '_')* [2]
    letter       ::= lowercase | uppercase
    lowercase    ::= 'a' | 'b' | ... | 'z'
    uppercase    ::= 'A' | 'B' | ... | 'Z'
    digit        ::= '0' | '1' | ... | '9'
    nonzerodigit ::= '1' | ... | '9'
    char         ::= any ASCII character between 33 and 126, with the
                     exception of 34, 40, 41, 42, 92 and 124 [3]
    string       ::= '"'char*'"'
    integer      ::= nonzerodigit digit* | '0'
    arit_op      ::= '+' | '-' | '×' | '/'
    logic_op     ::= 'and' | 'or' | 'not'
    comp_op      ::= '<' | '>' | '==' | '>=' | '<=' | '!='
    attr_op      ::= '=' | '->' | ':='

[1] Loosely based on:
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/fa11/python-grammar.html

[2] It must not match a keyword.

[3] More specifically, the ASCII indexes noted are in base 10. The list
starts at ! and ends with ~, excluding ", (, ), *, \ and |. Note that a string
must be enclosed within double quotes. More information about this character
set can be found on its manpage using the command

    man ascii

on a Unix-based OS.
